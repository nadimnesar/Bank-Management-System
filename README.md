# Bank Management System

This repository contains a Bank Management System implemented in Python using MySQL as the database. The system allows both users and admins to perform various banking operations such as checking account information, depositing money, withdrawing money, transferring money, and more.

## Installation

To run this system, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the `mysql-connector` library. You can install the required library using the following command:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector
```

You also need to have a MySQL server set up, and you can use XAMPP for local development.
